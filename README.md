# Sales and Customer Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales, customer behavior, and operational performance data from a retail business dataset. The primary objective is to derive actionable insights that will assist in improving customer satisfaction, optimizing logistics, and enhancing sales strategies. The project explores various aspects of the business, such as revenue trends, delivery times, customer distribution, and payment methods.

## Dataset Information

1. **Orders**: Contains details of all customer orders, including timestamps for order purchase, estimated delivery, and actual delivery.
2. **Payments**: Tracks payment details for each order, including payment method and installment information.
3. **Order Items**: Contains detailed information about the products in each order, including freight (shipping) costs.
4. **Customers**: Contains customer information such as state and unique identifiers.
5. **Sellers**: Details about the sellers and their associated orders.
